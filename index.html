			<p>"It's Donegal's biggest music festival and a chance for the people out there (and Donegal is pretty out there) to see some of the most exciting acts in music right now." say the folks at Irish broadcaster RTÃ‰. From its humble beginnings in 2008, Sea Sessions has grown into one of the island's top music festivals.

Set on the Wild Atlantic Way on the northwest coast of Ireland, the beach in Bundoran is where everyone gathers to enjoy surfing, music, skating, BMX, beach sports, graffiti and more. In the past, the festival has attracted big names such as Dizzee Rascal, Paul Weller, Tinie Tempah, Seasick Steve and Primal Scream. Here's to more awesome music and cool waves in the future!</p>
